# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Scaffolded the crate: single binary `trekr`, modules mirroring PLAN §4's
  layers, `script/check.sh` as the commit gate.
- Blob-layer extraction (`extract/`): Prism reads one blob's bytes into
  definitions, ancestry edges, constant references, and call sites carrying
  receiver shape. Semantics lifted from Shopify's Rubydex (MIT); the crate is
  not a dependency.
- Checkout scan (`scan/`): `git ls-files -s` for tracked blob OIDs, git's own
  `sha1("blob <len>\0" + bytes)` for anything the working tree has changed, so
  an uncommitted edit keys the same as it will once committed.
